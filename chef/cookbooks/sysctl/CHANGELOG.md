v0.5.0 (2014-05-16)
-------------------

* BREAKING CHANGE:
  For parameters to persist on reboot that are set via attributes, you now need to include
  `sysctl::persist` instead of `sysctl::default`. This allows LWRP users to use the cookbook
  without needing to load `sysctl::default` in their run list.

-------------------

* [GH-24] On RHEL Adjust Init file to follow chkconfig standards (Alex Farhadi)
* [GH-22] lwrp parameters are written to the sysctl config file (Sander van Zoest, Guilhem Lettron)
* Entries in the sysctl config file are now sorted
* Removed Thor development dependency
* Added LWRP Matcher for use with ChefSpec by wrapper cookbooks
* Added ChefSpec 3 unit tests
* Ported bats tests to ServerSpec integration tests
* Use platform_family? in attributes (requires Ohai 0.6.12)
* Renamed ruby_block[sysctl config notifier] to ruby_block[save-sysctl-params] for clarity

* LWRP now sets attributes on the node via node.default, not node.set allowing easier overrides by other cookbooks
